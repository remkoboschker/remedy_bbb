Feature: Restrict access to app refreshes to employees
    In order to limit the access to the app software
    as a developer
    I want to only allow employees (i.e. paying customers) to be able to refresh the app
    
    The app will be refreshed if the software on the server has a higher version number than the one in the app manifest.
